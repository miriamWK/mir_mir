			<h1 id="Architecture"> What is Web Architecture?</h1> 
			<p><!-- <q> Cite of a small snippet of text used from a website -->
				Whilst there are various definitions and distinctions made of the concept, web architecture is essentially the <q cite="https://en.ryte.com/wiki/Web_Architecture/">conceptual structure of the World Wide Web (WWW) </q>, <a href="https://en.ryte.com/wiki/Web_Architecture/">Ryte.com</a> according to Ryte.com's article on the subject. It includes the interconnection of various technical components such as complex computer systems and networks, built upon a medium known as the Internet. There is a common misconception that the Web and the Internet are the same, as the terms are often used interchangeably. However, there are subtle differences between the two. Primarily, the internet is a global network that is comprised of computers, which is connected by a protocol called the internet protocol or IP. Conversely, the WWW is a well known application that is built on top of the internet, and utilizes the hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) to navigate across different websites. The web can be summarised of a series of interactions between clients and servers, which forms the basis of this report.

				<a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/438/clientserver-architecture">Technopedia</a> defines client/server architecture as <q cite="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/438/clientserver-architecture">a computing model in which the server hosts, delivers and manages most of the resources and services to be consumed by the client.</q>On the client side, for example, the client sends requests to the server through a web browser, a phone or another device. Servers are applications that take the requests from the client, and deliver web content or services back to the client. There are various technical processes and prerequisites required which create this interesting interaction amongst clients and servers. Those prerequisites include the existence of protocols and markup languages, which are vital for communication between clients and servers and the necessary responses to take place between them.

			<section class="theme-section">
			<h2 id="Protocols">Protocols</h2>
			<p>
				There are various layers of protocols pertaining to the interaction between clients and servers. The first of which is called the ‘internet protocol’ (IP). Every client device and server have their own unique IP addresses, which are used communicate back and forth. IP addresses are a 32-bit number assigned by IP to each node of the network and are written as a tuple of 4 numbers. IP has many sub-protocols such as TCP and UDP, with the most well-known protocols being TCP/IP, which allows for reliable packet delivery. Protocols are set up with default ports, for example, HTTP:80, SMTP:25. These ports can be otherwise changed, however, this can cause server response errors and is best to leave them as their defaults. The following is a list of some common protocols and their definitions:

				 <dd>File Transfer Protocol, send/receives files to/from servers.</dd>	
			</dl>
			</div>
			</section>
			<p>
			    Furthermore, the primary communication protocol is HTTP which is a higher-level protocol, which is based upon TCP/IP and together allows web-based applications to communicate and exchange data. It is a one way stateless protocol, and once a request has been sent and received it is forgotten, which makes it a simple and efficient protocol. 
			</p>
			<h3>DNS and URL</h3>
			<p><!--Quotation link and hyperlink -->
			    The DNS protocol as mentioned above, is one of the most important processes on the web. It addresses the fundamental difference between humans and computers, as it translates the human readable text request, in the form of a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) into the request location’s IP address. <q cite=" https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSGMCP_5.1.0/com.ibm.cics.ts.internet.doc/topics/dfhtl_uricomp.html">A URL is used when a web client makes a request to a server for a resource. </q><a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSGMCP_5.1.0/com.ibm.cics.ts.internet.doc/topics/dfhtl_uricomp.html">(IBM.com)</a> The following is the anatomy of a URL:

			<!--new paragraph same section-->
			<p>
				Every website is associated with a unique domain name that is associated with its IP. DNS can be thought of as the ‘phone book of the internet’. When a client enters the URL via HTTP, the Internet Service Provider (ISP), routes the request to the DNS and the DNS routes the request to the destination IP, or website. 
			</p>
			</section>	
			<section class="theme-section">
			<h2 id="WebBrowsers">Web Browsers</h2>
			<p>
				On the client side, web browsers are used to request and view web pages. Common web browsers include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Opera; with Chrome being one of the most widely used due to it’s efficient functionality and adaptation to <q cite="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/4/16805216/google-chrome-only-sites-internet-explorer-6-web-standards">web standards</q><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/4/16805216/google-chrome-only-sites-internet-explorer-6-web-standards">(Theverge.com)</a>. In years past, not all browsers behaved the same way, and not all content was displayed uniformly across them. In 1998, the World Wide Consortium was developed, and they advocate a level of web standards in order to try and encourage consistency between browsers. 
			</p>
			<h3>Web Browser Functions</h3>
			<p>
				One of the many functions of web browsers, is to parse HyperText Markup Language (HTML) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and render the response to the client on the screen. Other functions include the networking element utilizing HTTP, data storage, and interpreting of Javascript (JS). The browser builds a Document Object Model Tree from the HTML, and integrates the assets (CSS, JS) into the tree as they arrive. The web page events are loaded, and the user then interacts with the page. 
			</p>
			<h3>Interesting Fact HTML</h3>
			<p>
				From it’s emanation, HTML provided the markup language necessary to structure content on the web. As the web evolved, content began to go beyond what HTML could structure. This lead vendors to create plug ins such as Adobe’s flash to get around limitations. This is what lead to the development of HTML5.

			<section class="theme-section">
			<h2 id="RequestResponseCycle">Request Response Cycle</h2>
			<p>
				The aforementioned sections discuss this cycle up to the point of the web browser rendering of content, however, there is a more complex technical process involved in this process. The request response cycle on the web works via HTTP messages, and URLs. A HTTP message contains three sections, the start line, headers, and the body. In terms of the request, there are various methods which send information to the PATH, and define the request semantics. An example of the GET method, would be a request for a bank account balance. What is significant here, is that this request cannot change the server state. However, a POST request for example, could be a bank transaction, which can change the server state. A HTTP response message is different from the request message, as it returns status codes as to whether the request was successful or not. For example, 200 status means request was 'ok'.

			<h2 id="WebServers">Web Servers</h2>
			<p>
				The basis of the internet is browsers/clients making requests to the server. The server is responsible for all responses. Linux, Apache, MySql and PHP (LAMP), is an example of a web site server configuration. However, there are more complex server types known are web application servers, which are set up differently to that of the Apache model. They are set up to respond to complex requests, and used by companies such as Twitter, or Facebook. They create HTML responses to the client <q cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_web_server">‘on the fly’</q> as pointed out by <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_web_server">Mozilla.com</a>, template files and JS requests. Due to the high level of web traffic these types of servers experience, the organisations use multiple servers of the same type. A Load Balancer is used as a scaling mechanism that helps to send the traffic to the server that has more capacity.
